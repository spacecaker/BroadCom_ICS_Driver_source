/**
 * \file vcos_semaphore.h
 *
 * \section sem Semaphores
 *
 * This provides counting semaphores. Semaphores are not re-entrant. On sensible
 * operating systems a semaphore can always be posted but can only be taken in 
 * thread (not interrupt) context. Under Nucleus, a LISR cannot post a semaphore,
 * although it would not be hard to lift this restriction.
 *
 * \subsection timeout Timeout
 *
 * On both Nucleus and ThreadX a semaphore can be taken with a timeout. This is
 * not supported by VCOS because it makes the non-timeout code considerably more
 * complicated (and hence slower). In the unlikely event that you need a timeout
 * with a semaphore, and you cannot simply redesign your code to avoid it, use
 * an event flag (vcos_event_flags.h).
 *
 * \subsection sem_nucleus Changes from Nucleus:
 *
 *  Semaphores are always "FIFO" - i.e. sleeping threads are woken in FIFO order. That's
 *  because:
 *  \arg there's no support for NU_PRIORITY in threadx (though it can be emulated, slowly)
 *  \arg we don't appear to actually consciously use it - for example, Dispmanx uses
 *  it, but all threads waiting are the same priority.
 *
